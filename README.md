# 🐝 BusyBee – Smart Study Spot Finder

**BusyBee** is a front-end prototype of a location-based web application designed to help students find ideal study environments based on factors such as crowd levels, Wi-Fi availability, and quiet zones.

This project is a **conceptual mockup** — it demonstrates layout, design, and user interface features using static content and visuals. While it does not use live APIs or real-time location services, it represents the **vision** of a potential study-spot-finder app.
